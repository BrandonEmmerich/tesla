Once you've \"done the impossible\", it's just assumed that you can and will do it again and again from now on. \r\n\r\nLiterally hundreds of people in one room, desks on top of each other, as many as possible in every little space. Companies claim that they\u2019re being \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201cprogressive\u201d by not having offices and cubicles, but they\u2019re just being cheap. Look at pictures of offices from the 1950\u2019s. You\u2019ll see the same hundreds of desks in a room.\r\n\r\nYearly raises are typically less than the cost of living\r\n\r\nWork/life balance is mediocre at best\r\n\r\nSmallish yearly bonuses in the form of golden handcuffs. RSUs that vest over 4 years, so you\u2019ll wait a long time to benefit from them\r\n\r\nThose who were hired before mid-2013 made a lot of money off stock options, but many of those people are leaving now that all of their options are used up. \r\n\r\nRevolving door. It\u2019s hard to last more than a couple of years here. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s always seemingly a few steps away from massive failure\r\n\r\nVery few processes in place, so work is done extremely inefficiently\r\n\r\nVery common to compose an email and see \u201cThis is no longer a valid Tesla address\u201d\r\n\r\nThe entire Service organization shares one budget. I am scrimping to save $50 on software while a barely-related manager wastes literally tens of thousands of dollars a week on cool toys, and it all comes from the same place.\r\n\r\nEverything\u2019s urgent, and people try to name-drop that Elon\u2019s watching this very project so I need to stop everything for them. Luckily those of us who have been around for a while see right through that charade.\r\n\r\nTechnically, no 401(k) match, though if you\u2019re careful with the health benefits you choose, you can end up with some leftover that can be diverted into the 401(k).\r\n\r\nMiddle managers are very hit-and-miss. Many were promoted because a manager was needed and they were the only one who knew anything about the department. Much room for improvement here.\r\n\r\nMinimal leadership training. No real employee development opportunities. The results are just as bad as you\u2019d expect.\r\n\r\nMassive inter-departmental struggles. Most of my problems can be traced to one power-hungry manager of a sister department. It only takes one person to ruin the work lives of many people. \r\n\r\nThere are more meetings than I expected from this kind of company. Elon sent a great email about how wasteful meetings are, but people have fallen into old bad habits.\r\n\r\nCompletely ineffective HR department\r\n\r\nEvery department is grossly understaffed, just barely above the point of collapse. Nearly everyone has to work harder than they would if they were doing the same job at another company.\r\n\r\nAnything that they can do in house, they\u2019ll do, rather than outsourcing to a supplier. There are people who spend their whole careers deciding \u201cmake vs. buy\u201d\u2026 no need for them here, it seems. This is corporate arrogance, and it reduces quality, wastes human resources, and slows time to market in many cases. A positive side effect is that more products are made here in California than would be if they were outsourced.\r\n\r\nInadequate parking\r\n\r\nNote to hiring managers at other companies: Watch out if someone from Tesla has \u201cProject Manager\u201d on their title.

Production seems unwilling to help quality in every situation and not informing quality when a quality situation arises. \r\n\r\nFavoritism within all departments. Some associates are allowed to take 30 minute breaks and hour long lunches while others sometimes only get their lunch. Supervisors and managers do not enforce HR policies, safety policies and workmanship policies. \r\n\r\nLake Tesla- Parking lot doesn't have drainage. When it snows and rains the parking lot becomes flooded . \r\n\r\nTime off policy- You can only take a day off if you have pto and there is no unpaid time off. This means if you're sick and have no pto you're forced to come into work sick. This is terrible business practice and shows the company  doesn't care about employee's. There should be pto and unpaid time off. A good company will give you pto and up to 40 hours of unpaid time off to cover times when you're sick and have no pto. \r\n\r\nRoad Condition- The road conditions are terrible here. Poor lighting, huge pot holes, and poor road striping. \r\n\r\nOverall: Find a better and more enjoyable palce to work.

So it doesn\u2019t matter what ACTUALLY happens to a customer, just make sure you call enough people in a day. \n\nNo improvement - Management and neighboring departments ask what they can improve, when agents respond and actually give examples in which such changes would apply, the answers are always \u201cNo\u201d and/or \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d - which only shows the disconnect from all departments. No one listens to anyone. How are we supposed to work together when we can\u2019t even get along ourselves?\n\nYou\u2019re punished for wanting more - You can\u2019t simply ask for improvements, and/or FIGHT for what a customer needs (not even above and beyond, literally requesting the minimum requirements in order for a solar project to go forward.) is a battle EVERYTIME. You have to almost harass to the point of exhaustion. \n\nOver worked - I can list off every department that is insanely understaffed, but to be transparent I\u2019ll list examples in which we\u2019re severely lacking:\n - It is taking 3+ months to get a piece of paper from another department (inspections) to move a customers account. It has literally been stuck. I have looped in my, and their management countless times, in person and email without any response or a sign of help or concern. \n - The utility relations team has dropped the ball so many times its expected. It\u2019s an entry job with little to no training, they never submit applications correct or complete, and when you call them out or tell them so they can resubmit soon (Because by this point the application has already been submitted 8weeks) they usually bark at you and tell you not to contact them directly - but rather to email their queue team that 1) Doesn\u2019t exist anymore 2) They are not the agents who submit anyways, they do not know how to correct applications. When they attempt it\u2019s just rubbing salt in the wound.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency - Management says this all the time, but trust me they\u2019re so disconnected they couldn\u2019t even tell you how to do the job you\u2019re working under for. They ask you call as many people you can in a day and send as many emails as you can but the second you find a flaw on a project they blame you and tell you to figure it out. There are countless times I\u2019ve had to loop in 10-20 people on an issue and panic everyday for a week for someone to understand there is a need higher than what u can provide. Customer experience is ruined because no one cares. The application teams are infamous for playing golf in the middle of the office, while they\u2019re taking 7-9 business days to acknowledge and email you sent requesting they correct the applications that they submitted incorrectly\n\nYou\u2019re constantly in negative and upsetting settings - Management holds weekly meetings and all they do for 30 mins is give the third degree on how dissatisfied they are and how awful you and your team are, while reminding you, you are only showing other people why we do not need to exist. Don\u2019t worry though, when we ask management to allow the improvements to do better they simply say \u201cFigure that out yourself\u201d and/or \u201cNo.\u201d And laugh. Not only that, Sales Support Specialists are held to a much more burning quality standard than anyone else AKA when the application team takes 4 weeks to notice a rejection (that I do not have access to.) because they\u2019re playing golf, I will be the agent to be yelled at not only by the sales rep and the customer, but by management because I must be stupid to if not known.\n\nNo one will tell you how to improve but they all remind you you suck. - they have a spreadsheet that talks about your reviews, standard \u201cRed, yellow, green.\u201d Ranking. They almost always give you red and yellow and will never tell you why. Myself and multiple agents have asked for more information and more insight in this grading and they just don\u2019t give it to us. Good old \u201cyeah soon.\u201d.. \u201csoon\u201d has been months. But they continue to mark good jobs as red, reminding you you suck, but uh.. offer no help to improve.\n\nThis is the most backwards and negative place I\u2019ve ever been. Everyday is tough and I am happy to be leaving. The solar side will not survive long.\n\nElon always sends emails about his precious cars.. what about those PWs Elon?

This isn\u2019t a choice either. Unqualified managers that could barely make it as a Wal-Mart greeter tell you what to do. You better do it because if you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t care about your job. The managers will tell you that you have to work 10 hour days in a Home Depot until you meet their goals. This can take a day or two (if you\u2019re a lying scumbag) or it could take a a solid week. You better hit their arbitrary goals or you\u2019re a terrible employee. \r\n2.) False promises. You will be promised $400k a year. What that means is you\u2019re actually going to make $30k year. If you want $70k a year, you better be willing to work 90 hours a week. In Tesla\u2019s eyes, you work for what you bring home. So forget your home life, do the work they demand and you\u2019ll be rich. Not true. You might bring home $70k for devoting your life to a bunch of Solarcity managers that barely made it out of high school but were strong at deceiving people in door to door sales. Imagine that, a door to door sales guy that mislead you?  Well, he\u2019s your boss. So...if you want $400k a year, you better get your lying game on. Haha...actually, $400k will never happen. They flat out lied about that. \r\n3.) Carrots.  Not the sweet ones that are oh so delicious. You will get carrots dangled in front of you about your potential and how great you are. What they are doing is making you feel good about your background and how you\u2019ll be awesome at Tesla. What really happens is they don\u2019t care. The carrots are there to make you feel good about making  ~$5 an hour only to be criticized because you couldn\u2019t make someone commit to a $50k solar install the first time you met with them. Nine times out of 10, if one makes a commitment on the first visit...they decide to cancel. Tesla holds you accountable if your customers don\u2019t commit on the first visit.  \r\n4.) Forced to break the law: Tesla encourages their employees to get a customer signature on a legally binding document. What the customer doesn\u2019t know is there is a box where the document is supposed to be notarized.

Several fellow interns even pulled 70 or 80 hour weeks consistently. I do mean it when I say I looked forward to getting to work every day. Despite this, I was consistently exhausted and very stressed out. While I was able to deal with this kind of environment for the summer, I do not see myself lasting long in it in a full time role. This is an additional benefit to interning here, as it allowed me to see this environment to know if I was the type of person who could thrive in it. Overall, if you want to work at Tesla full time, you should know where your values lie. If you love your craft, and love to work this may be a place you'll love. While not impossible, I can see life outside of work (relationships, hobbies) becoming more difficult because of a job here.", "ceoApproval": "No Opinion", "currentJob": false, "overallNumeric": 4, "workLifeBalanceRating": 1, "seniorLeadershipRating": 4, "id": 18068451, "notHelpfulCount": 0, "headline": "Intern - Full recommendation; Full time - Know your values", "pros": "I have worked as an intern at several locations, and none has pushed me (in a good way), as much as Tesla did.

One common criticism of internships is the way one is treated as an intern, where questions go unexplained or are deflected simply due to them being low priority coming from an intern. This was not a common problem at Tesla. The people I worked with were among the smartest I've ever met. They were truly passionate about their crafts and they contributed to an atmosphere where it felt as though everyone was walking to a common goal.

The footprint of malls are shrinking with more and more stores closing, resulting in a fewer foot traffic. \r\n-Being told that cold calls are not allowed, and only reaching out to those who have raised their hand for additional information. \r\n-Marketing yourself through social media is very restricted and don't want images, or videos to be portrayed in the wrong light. \r\n-Management across the board in multiple departments with no real life experiences\r\n-No discount on the purchase of a their vehicles, only on lease programs which if you live in state that offers state incentives they would waive the sales tax which there is no savings. \r\n-Dress code from HQ doesn't match to what is actually expected in each store. \r\n-No 401k match", "ceoApproval": "Approve", "currentJob": false, "overallNumeric": 1, "workLifeBalanceRating": 1, "seniorLeadershipRating": 5, "id": 15609177, "notHelpfulCount": 0, "headline": "Owner Advisor", "pros": "You have the ability to be part of something truly amazing with Electric Vehicles.

Horrible, unqualified management, 2.) low pay, extreme hours and high demand, 3.) zero support and poor communication. \r\n\r\nThe long version:\r\nManagement, particularly on the sales side of the organization, is a major failure. Starting from the top down, the initiative for the past couple years has been to bring in people from the fashion or \"high end retail\" industries who have ZERO knowledge of the product, the company culture, the automotive industry, and no desire to actually learn about it. These people are given management positions without proper training or education, and lack even minimal base knowledge to do their jobs well so instead they rely on statistics/metrics in hopes that they can succeed by playing a numbers game. They do not have good intentions for the company or it's long-term success, and have completely destroyed what was once a great culture and environment to be a part of. People who have worked for the company for years and dedicated themselves to the mission aren't given any consideration, and very few promotions from within ever occur anymore. There is rampant sexism and favoritism at almost every level, if you have any aspirations to advance in your career, it won't happen here. \r\n\r\nThe pay is awful, you will be expected to work a minimum of 60-70 hours a week, available 7 days a week, for a 40hr/week salary. Commission for sales is insulting (approximately one-thousandth of a percent of the cost of the vehicle), you don't get paid until the car is delivered (which, as a member of the sales team, you have ZERO control over and can take 8+ weeks in some cases), and you get to work in an environment where your employment is constantly being threatened by your boss(es). \r\n\r\nHR doesn't do anything to correct any issues brought to their attention, they do not look out for the interest of the employees in any way, shape, or form. Emails and phone calls to just about any department often go ignored on a consistent basis, and regardless of how valid it may be, no one at any level of management wants to hear about the problems that exist and how to fix them. If you speak up, you will most certainly have a target on your back and I guarantee you will be subject to retaliation at some point or another. It is abundantly clear that the employees who are down in the trenches, bending over backwards to try and achieve targets and satisfy customers are thought of as completely expendable.

This made getting time off difficult, because the inexperienced sales managers looked at it as a lack of work ethic that would damage sales instead of a normal human need. Their immaturity also showed when they are confronted with new sales ideas. These were met with suspicion or general disinterest as if they already knew everything possible about automotive sales, a task the organization is absurdly new to. \n\nThere was also a lack of organized career paths to move up interdepartmentally or change departments from, for example, sales to engineering or marketing. There were promises of growth first from the recruiters and later the sales managers, but to no avail. Managers moved around so much that the benchmark to gain promotion moved just as frequently, so you're left tossing in the waves.\n\nTesla is amazingly forward thinking on automotive and sustainable technology but, in the walls of the sales department, it already felt stale, confusing, too lethargic towards new ideas and too rigid for new talent to grow.", "ceoApproval": "Approve", "currentJob": false, "overallNumeric": 2, "workLifeBalanceRating": 2, "seniorLeadershipRating": 3, "id": 13870508, "notHelpfulCount": 1, "headline": "A young company with bright ideas, but many internal challenges.", "pros": "It's exciting to work for a company that's so bold and innovative.

This gets carried to such an extreme that often the emphasis gets shifted from giving actual results to giving the APPEARANCE of results to satisfy your superiors.  I've seen this happen at all levels and I earnestly think it's a \"trickle down\" effect, judging from what I hear from those higher up.  This of course can lead to poor results in the long term, but few people are so noble as to jeopardize their jobs in the short term for the long term good of the company.  Rather than simply making demands, I recommend starting conversations about the difficulties and requirements of a process and try to problem solve with people.\r\n\r\nInstructions are often handed down as absolutes, typically without explanation or any room for feedback.  This is unfortunate, since the individuals closer to the processes in question often have useful insights.  If you keep people out of the loop on the grounds that \"you're in charge,\" you miss out on relevant information and have fewer eyes and minds on the problem at hand.  Perhaps, before the time comes to make a decision, when you've first noticed a potential problem, talk to the people involved and get their feedback, even if the people are only technicians or associates.  If you explain why decisions were made they were, this helps on multiple levels too.  For starters, it helps with motivation, because people don't feel like they're being arbitrarily ordered around.  Additionally, if people understand the actual goals behind the instructions they're given, it allows them greater versatility and thoroughness in serving that goal.  In other words: they can serve the principle of the law, not just the letter.\r\n\r\nRumors abound about individuals who made a mistake and were fired on the spot for it.  Whether or not these stories are true, it engenders a culture of fear among employees.  This doesn't result in an absence of mistakes (which is impossible), but rather, mistakes are denied and covered up.  In this situation, mistakes are slower to be identified (if they're identified at all), slower to be corrected (if at all), and there's less opportunity for learning on the part of individuals and the institution.  Try to encourage an open environment that allows people to come forward without so much fear or reprisals.  (To paraphrase Deming: \"What, are you going to fire every person who makes mistakes and hire only people who don't make mistakes?\")  I know there's lip service to an open environment, but having the CEO's email address doesn't count for much if you receive semi-threatening orders from your superiors NOT to email Elon about something, nor do people necessarily feel comfortable giving earnest feedback to senior management when you hear things like \"People who don't tell Elon what he wants to hear don't last long.\"", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": 0, "overall": "Dissatisfied", "recommendToFriend": false, "cultureAndValuesRating": 1, "jobInformation": "I worked at Tesla full-time (more than a year)", "totalHelpfulCount": 27, "ceoRating": 2, "helpfulCount": 27, "attributionURL": "https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tesla-RVW12866128.htm", "newReviewFlag": false}, {"cons": "Some poor hiring practices and not as much support being so far away from the headquarters", "ceoApproval": "Approve", "currentJob": false, "overallNumeric": 5, "workLifeBalanceRating": 2, "seniorLeadershipRating": 3, "id": 13010991, "notHelpfulCount": 0, "headline": "Client advisor", "pros": "Amazing company making many of the right decisions and changing the industry", "jobTitleFromDb": "Sales Advisor/Marketing Specialist", "location": "New York, NY", "careerOpportunitiesRating": 4, "isFeaturedReview": false, "lengthOfEmployment": "for less than a year", "reviewDateTime": "2016-12-15 08:05:46.347", "employmentStatus": "full-time", "jobTitle": "Sales Advisor/Marketing Specialist", "advice": "", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": 2, "overall": "Very Satisfied", "recommendToFriend": true, "cultureAndValuesRating": 5, "jobInformation": "I worked at Tesla full-time (less than a year)", "businessOutlook": "Getting Better", "totalHelpfulCount": 2, "ceoRating": 1, "helpfulCount": 2, "attributionURL": "https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tesla-RVW13010991.htm", "newReviewFlag": false}, {"cons": "Need to work hard towards managing your work and life balancing.\r\nHave to put lot of efforts to get job done.", "ceoApproval": "Approve", "currentJob": true, "overallNumeric": 5, "workLifeBalanceRating": 3, "seniorLeadershipRating": 5, "id": 13073886, "notHelpfulCount": 0, "headline": "Intern", "pros": "Good to learn concepts.\r\nHands on experience on Auto OEM\r\nGood responsibilities", "jobTitleFromDb": "Intern - Hourly", "location": "Fremont, CA", "careerOpportunitiesRating": 5, "isFeaturedReview": false, "lengthOfEmployment": "", "reviewDateTime": "2016-12-21 13:52:53.63", "employmentStatus": "", "jobTitle": "Intern - Hourly", "advice": "", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": 5, "overall": "Very Satisfied", "cultureAndValuesRating": 4, "jobInformation": "I have been working at Tesla", "totalHelpfulCount": 0, "ceoRating": 1, "helpfulCount": 0, "attributionURL": "https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tesla-RVW13073886.htm", "newReviewFlag": false}, {"cons": "China is the second largest market for Tesla and everyone here at Tesla China is working their butts off to reach every target sales/inventory sales for the quarter; \r\n* We get paid by 3 times less than avg Tesla employees in the US (a product specialist get paid about $6.34/hr before tax in China), while striving to double and even triple the amount of sales quarter after quarter. \r\n* With only 20- 30 Tesla stores opened to date in China, headcounts from sales to delivery to order operations are extremely limited due to low budget set by the company, everyone is working 3-4 times over what they were signed up for, while enjoy the lowest base pay across the planet.\r\n* Provided the so-called best health insurance for employees, but it was mainly a hoax.

You might get some support setting up and executing an event only if they approve of it but no money can be spent for these ideas, so this only can go so far.\r\n\r\nLocal store (manager) sales goals are not related to the individual owner advisor sales goals at all. Manager can hit bonus level much quicker while individual OAs will get in trouble for not hitting a much higher individual number. Regardless of region, state, or store level traffic, the individual OA is held accountable for the same sales number across the country, this doesn't make any since as not all regions, states, city's have the same traffic and interest. \r\n\r\nZero path or internal support for career growth. Have been hearing about how they are working on that for over 2 years now but still nothing no internal career portal as of this writing. Regional level management sees you as a number and you will not be recognized as a person unless you are knocking your numbers out of the park, \"what have you done for me lately?\" mentality. If you are a puppet and enjoy being at someones beck and call then your looking for the right place. Zero advertising and majority of the public still thinks buying the vehicles is illegal in most states, so you normally start the sales process from that step. Requires a TON of educating before you can actually move to the sales/closing process. \r\n\r\nWhat work life balance? Not asked but expected to work 6/7 days a week, there are no 9-5 positions here so don't waste your time. Given a phone and laptop, enough said!  You will be expected to bleed for this company and only if your a top performer will you exist in managements eyes. Very young managers that have a shelf life of approx 9 months tenure before they leave the company or transfer to another role.

Teams are constantly chasing one fire after the other. Management will always over promise, and based on their lack of patience and institutional experience, work their employees to the bone to try to get close to what they had promised. \r\n\r\nResources are not allocated for a sustainable growth plan. Finance is seen as a back end activity and is not given adequate attention, causing it to fall behind as the company grows. Management needs to realize Finance bridges the gap to connect the company owners (shareholders) to operations. If you can't rely on the financials, you should not partake in ownership of the company. Tesla gets a free pass at a lot of it's activities due to the brand image. There are a lot of hidden bodies that are bound to be found at some point. The culture encourages somewhat of a cover up or a way to push financial issues down the road. Top dollar is paid to make a nasty outlook and financial result, seem good...but again, they don't get enough scrutiny. If an employee raises an issue that is not on management's list of 'will this news bring more money' ... it get's buried and the employee is removed from future meetings so they always get filtered. This is a big reason as to why there is such high turnover in the Finance and Accounting group. Throwing money (equity) their way just makes them more uncomfortable in doing the dirty work. Invest the money, get more reliable results, an investors need to aware that even the auditors are drinking the Kool Aid in expectation that their profile will have the next Google or Apple. \r\n\r\nThe SEC and PCAOB should really look deeper. Ask the employees who left as to why they left. 'Anonymous feedback' posted by the SEC is mocked and people are actively sought to try to find a 'one on one' fix, which is ridiculous. I was extremely uncomfortable with such behavior having come from an audit background and could not endorse such behavior from Legal or Finance.

Manufacturing process control and quality assurance is amateur at best. Senior management overpromises on schedule and delivery numbers (driven from the top) but does not have the industry expertise and patience/discipline to deliver. Management's solution to their own incompetence is to work their employees harder, but this negative cycle is unsustainable. Many of the best employees leave and take their institutional knowledge with them. This exodus impacts production and management responds by making the new employees and those that stay work even harder still, driving more of the good employees out the door. You get the idea.\r\n\r\nOperations management is young and inexperienced. There is no Tim Cook to match Elon's Steve Jobs act. Few managers have prior automotive industry experience. Many decisions are seat-of-the-pants and it shows in the numbers and workflow. Operations executive turnover is high as Elon has little patience when these ill-prepared managers do not produce quick results. As a result of turnover and general disorganization, org decisions (hiring, promotion, layoffs) are largely political, not driven by KPIs or performance.\r\n\r\nPay is well below market. Much of the compensation package is given as equity, but long gone are the days when the equity awards had upside potential. The stock price is sky high, and employees are likely to see their equity award's value shrink or remain flat over their vesting cycle.\r\n\r\nOverall, employees are treated as expendable. Training opportunities are basically nonexistence. Promotion is political and extremely competitive (unless you worked with a manager at their previous company or came from Apple).\r\n\r\nThe few fringe perks once offered (free cereal and fruit, lunch vouchers for those who don't drive to work, and the occasional company party) have been almost entirely cut as a symbolic austerity gesture by finance.\r\n\r\nWith acquisition of Solar City, an already unfocused, disorganized operation now has a huge curveball to deal with.

Employee tenure is crazy short. Engagement is also low in many parts of the organization. Sure, you can probably hire smart, fresh faced kids to replace last year's crop, but the turnover and loss of institutional knowledge will slowly destroy the company.\r\n\r\nStop trying to do the cool thing and focus on execution. Not every process needs to be reinvented. Tesla does not need to make every single part in-house. Hone in on core competencies and drive operational efficiency. In short, make the company more boring. This probably means forcing Elon to stay out of technical decision making when he isn't properly equipped to contribute to the conversation. It also means ditching the Solar City acquisition, which is an unnecessary distraction at a time when the company just reported a big miss on production numbers.\r\n\r\nHire industry veterans, not wiz-kid tech talent, to run your operations organization. The company needs their deep experience and best practices. The young talent will still bring plenty of innovation to the table. And the mentoring will go a long way to improving middle management.\r\n\r\nAnd as for middle management, take a good hard look at who you have promoted over the last 2 years. Some mistakes were made.

Going over your manager is almost expected if that is the best/quickest way forward. Goals are determined collaboratively and you are mostly left to your own to achieve the solution. Manager helps in getting resources or giving direction as required and periodic checks on progress help keep you on track.

It's exciting to be a part of Tesla Motors at first, because who doesn't want to work for Tesla Motors right? \r\n\r\nThere are many cons to consider when working in the sales/retail line of Tesla Motors. This isn't just my perspective, simply Google Tesla Motor's employee retention rate and let the numbers speak for itself. First of, there is zero work life balance. Part time employees work 35-40 hours a week without health benefits. Time slots between October-December Floating Time Off and Paid Time off are blocked off, causing additional stress for employees who have families from out of the states/country, or want to utilize their Floating Time Off before it restarts at the beginning of the year. \r\n\r\nSome managers are hired from the retail industry without any expertise in car sales which causes the team to sink because their answer to every team member's question is \"I don't know.\" Not only do they not know the answer to a problem, they also fail to obtain additional phone/email contacts of skilled professionals who can help answer difficult leasing and financing questions for their team. Long story short, there is no leadership and guidance. In other words, employees are not equipped with the right tools to set them up for success, even if they take it upon themselves to learn from outside sources. \r\n\r\nLastly, if you've been at Tesla Motors for a while (1+ year), you'll start noticing that rarely, does anyone get promoted from within. I've seen many people who were \"promised\" a promotion for their hard work and seniority within the company, but sadly, every single hire for that same non-entry level position would get hired from outside. The most mind blowing aspect of HR and upper management recruitment is the fact that the new hires for the non-entry level automotive sales position fail to posses ANY prior automotive experience, neither do they have expertise on how Model S or Model X functions.\r\n\r\nIf you want growth and leadership, I'm sure positions in Northern California will be a better opportunity within Tesla.", "ceoApproval": "No Opinion", "currentJob": true, "overallNumeric": 1, "workLifeBalanceRating": 1, "seniorLeadershipRating": 1, "id": 12219639, "notHelpfulCount": 0, "headline": "The Retail Perspective", "pros": "Tesla is a very innovative company to be a part of.

At my particular location I experienced a lot of disappointment in company decisions and who they allow to call the shots. After being hired as an owner advisor (sales person) I got a substantial salary pay cut after only two weeks. I was told to \"roll with the punches\" and \"aren't I lucky to be part of this great mission and the Tesla team?\" I continued the job but not without notifying HR that it seemed extremely misleading and unfair considering I had turned down other job offers to work at Tesla with the initial income we agreed upon in mind. They reminded me that they can change how much they pay their employees, that changes could be made whenever they want, as often as they want and there's nothing I can do about it. The general public seems to think that the sales staff is commission based or receives a large percentage of commission per car and this is not true. Unlike car dealerships, the sales staff is either hourly or salary with a lousy fluctuating commission of under $100 per car (average Model S sells for about 110k). That being said, the overall pay is nowhere near what people think. Tesla tends to hire a young staff and seeks \"energetic and innovative talent\" but this could be because no seasoned professional would tolerate drastic company-wide policy changes and what goes on behind the scenes. I left a career at Tesla Motors because I could not tolerate my manager's behavior one moment longer. I contacted HR multiple times because he had created such a hostile work environment.  Every co-worker I had at the time and every single one after me has contacted HR about this man. Every single one. He's a huge liability to the company and yet miraculously still has the same job, having only been given light warnings for his actions. Early on while I was still training he cursed me out in front of customers and my new coworkers. He wanted me to follow around one of the sales members like a puppy, not leaving their side and when I went across the room to get something he used profanities at me because I disobeyed his orders and wasn't following their every shadow. He told me to pretend like I have a rope tied to my waist and my co-workers waist. This was in front of my new colleagues and a customer he was talking to. It was humiliating and demeaning. I would soon come to find that this guy lives for drama. He tries to play the employees against each other by stirring up rumors and gossip and creating jealousy by giving sales-orders (and with it commission) to whomever he likes most that week. He curses at employees, yells and points in their faces, makes employees come into work on days off and makes them do excessive work from home during time off. So much verbal abuse, harassment, drama, ego-trips, power-trips, and aggression. It often left the staff shaking, crying or just quitting all together. I was eventually offered a promotion and graciously accepted. I'd be transferring to the delivery department and would finally get away from this guy. Weeks turned into months before I went to job shadow. It was 5 months later before they were ready for me but it wasn't at the location I had been promised and training at rather an hour and a half away. I declined because I did not want a 3 hour daily commute and was always told I'd be working at the place 20 minutes from my house. When I declined they tried putting me on a guilt trip saying, \"it's a shame you'd pass up such an amazing opportunity because of your car. And we were going to offer you ___(an amount lower than my sales salary)\". In short, it was never a promotion, just a way to incise me to work there. Some say delivery is worse than sales. A guy I know who works there is sometimes required to work seven days a week during every end of the quarter. Seven! How is this legally possible? For the 60-70 hour work weeks he put in (I am not exaggerating here) his salary divided into hourly didn't fall below minimum wage so it was legal even though he was working around the clock, making minimum wage with no overtime compensation. Once the realization hit that there was no place better to transfer to (unless I wanted to relocate to headquarters in Palo Alto) I knew my days with Tesla were officially numbered. The last straw came when my manger came into work on his day off for the sole purpose of yelling at me because he didn't like the way I worded an email. Worst work experience of my life. So bittersweet because everyone who finds out I worked for Tesla praises the car, the company and knows me to be passionate for the cause (I drive an EV and still preach Tesla). But if they know me well enough, they've heard the stories of a company that's still working out the kinks and a sales manager who is so absurdly inappropriate and out of line.", "ceoApproval": "", "currentJob": false, "overallNumeric": 1, "workLifeBalanceRating": 1, "seniorLeadershipRating": 1, "id": 7249391, "notHelpfulCount": 0, "headline": "Great mission.

The once atmospheric rise of stock doesn\u2019t cut it anymore to make up the difference.\r\n\r\n2) Work/life balance. What balance? Time off on weekends or on vacations is a misnomer, requiring one to catch up while away so you aren\u2019t hopelessly behind when you return. You may not hear management say, \"You have to work on weekends/vacations\" but only if you\u2019re not listening. They create work-a-holics by tasking you 30 hrs over what you can physically accomplish every week. Manufacturing lines shooting out emails, calls, etc. at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am is common and the production side expectation of covering all hours of line operation is absolutely ridiculous and responsibilities need to be delegated/divided.\r\n\r\n3) Poor management. The issue is that a majority of people love Tesla because they think they\u2019ll get to work on cool product & interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop sustainable systems & emotional intelligence. People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they spoon feed high priority info upward, making their visibility they output of their work. So there are layers of non-value add individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no system to actually do anything about that because \"emotional intelligence\" or \"sustainable systems\" are not taken seriously.\r\n\r\n4) Schmucks, the fast paced environment in combination with the spoon feeding middle management results in a toxic atmosphere, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. Many managers straight-up intimidate/scare their employees into compliance of doing exactly what they want them to at that exact time (extreme micromanagement), without even understanding the priorities that person has (resulting in no-win situations and poor performance overall).  This intimidation is a blue collar management tactic that doesn\u2019t work on highly trained, highly intelligent engineers.\r\n\r\n5) It's a big company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.

Things are rapidly becoming super corporate and the way things are run, seems very systematic and machine-like.  Before, it was more about overall customer experience.  Now, it's be efficient, get their info, pass on the lead to make a sale.   \r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to become full-time at Tesla, be aware that you start part-time 30hrs a week at $13/hr, no commission, for about a year before you will be considered for a promotion, even if your work performance is solid.  Salary for a full-timer in sales is about $40,000 annually.  Commission is $60-$70 for every car you sell.  This is factual information. Yes, I do find it a bit strange that you get $60 dollars for every $100,000 car you sell, BUT on the bright side, you still get your $40,000. (Note: Sales and delivery positions count for 90-95% of the company's jobs)\r\n\r\nRecently, they have been increasing entry-level position, part-time workers and decreasing the number of full-time workers because from a corporate standpoint, you do not have to pay healthcare, benefits, etc., less money to be put out.  The goal is to have more part-time workers to do a full-time worker jobs for less benefits and less company expenses for the benefit of the corporation, as well as top shareholders.  I think this model is a fantastic idea to follow if you own a big corporation.  If I ever own a corporation, I want to follow this example to increase my wealth.  Very smart idea!\r\n\r\nTesla Motors, though, is a good company, esp with the technology and innovative machines they are creating.  I really hope they strive to help mother earth in 2-3 years with their $30,000-$50,000 vehicle to positively preserve the environment for the better of the every man.  Realistically, how it's going, I think it'll be more towards the $40,000-$50,000 range vs. $30,000 because it has to make company profit.\r\n\r\nOverall though, I hope that Tesla can positively impact the world and really help people in polluted cities and make the world a healthier and happier place to live in (while keeping it at an affordable price for the majority of people to buy for the sake of the environment)!", "ceoApproval": "Approve", "currentJob": false, "overallNumeric": 2, "workLifeBalanceRating": 2, "seniorLeadershipRating": 4, "id": 4641396, "notHelpfulCount": 0, "headline": "2.7 out of 5 stars.

As Tesla continues to grow to support all of its upcoming activities (read the news) one of its biggest challenges is management. It is very apparent that the culture to a degree is shifting from a \"start-up\" mentality to a very particular vision of what proper management should look like. This includes leveling, improving documentation, enforcing best-practices, etc. There is one very big drawback that anyone looking to join a cutting edge company should be wary of: this is slowly KILLING the original culture of doing what is necessary, thinking outside the box, promoting cross-group interaction. Elon won\u2019t ever let this culture shift touch the side of innovation and technological advance thankfully. This I am certain of as it would kill the heart of Tesla's edge.\r\n\r\nI have been fortunate enough in my career that I just made it onto the \"old Tesla' side of the team. This is a group of people who recognize there are management challenges and there is need to improve on those now, but also understand there is a need to minimize internal politics to remain one team. It is also a team of individuals that have leveraged and maintained a particular amount of political pull to keep that system in-line to a degree. Let me draw on one generic example. A large group discovered a flaw that was in part due to decisions made along with another group, and instead of approaching the problem with a \u201clet\u2019s fix this\u201d attitude, they \u201cstrategically waited\u201d until the other group confronted and accepted responsibility before acting towards resolution. This, in my mind, is unacceptable. \r\n\r\nWhat I have been witnessing in the transformation of the company is a greater dependence on politics.  Be prepared if you are an associate level engineer to be told exactly what you are allowed to do. And if you are senior level, know that you are entering potentially shark-infested waters depending on what division you are working for. Ask as you apply and interview to learn more about the dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe last downside is compensation. Tesla targets average pay, nothing less, nothing more, unless you are a rare candidate with such specific expertise that no one else like you exists. If you are that individual, you will be treated well (senior manager, exec, VP level). As a new hire, you do not have as much of an edge with your options. Your strike price will also be significantly higher than \u201colder\u201d Tesla colleagues. You will get paid enough to live on, but without the added bonus of ISOs at your side helping to ease the pain as you work tirelessly each and every day, you will find it more difficult to make it at Tesla. \r\n\r\nThe company and used top talent and let them go off to other companies after they were burnt and ground to ashes. I\u2019ve seen some of the best engineers leave under these circumstances. And as many other reviewers have mentioned, if you decide to take a job with this promising company, know you WILL sacrifice work-life balance, your family with see less of you, and you will have to make sacrifices while you stay at Tesla. You will get down and dirty. In return you will hopefully receive bonuses and rewards for your hard work and you can say you were part of it all, changing the mindset of all people, and shifting the paradigm and direction of personal-vehicle technology.", "ceoApproval": "Approve", "currentJob": true, "overallNumeric": 4, "workLifeBalanceRating": 1, "seniorLeadershipRating": 3, "id": 3028285, "notHelpfulCount": 0, "headline": "Company moves faster than the Model S", "pros": "I am a multi-disciplined test engineer. I have been with the company with quite some time and have worked across most engineering groups with the exception of the infotainment division.\r\n\r\n- ISOs and RSUs. I entered prior to the stock hike. Company-provided options and RSU grants for achievement has been a big financial reward and will continue to be until full vesting. This is important and one of the top three reasons Tesla has me staying put with the company (see Cons below)\r\n- Opportunities to learn. The company moves fast and because of that there has been a multitude of opportunities for me to interact across various technical groups. I have had the opportunity without any hindrances, due to my role, to gain a holistic understanding of the technology behind this vehicle. It's special to say the very least.\r\n- Bright minds. Tesla has acquired top-talent in its early days (I cannot say the same now see below). the backbone of the company has been the engineers with the confidence and courage to tackle challenges no one else has ever attempted. Many other automotive companies have come to recognize that Tesla is a competitor and looming threat.\r\n- Advancement. Up until recent months, Tesla did a fairly decent jobs at providing opportunities for advancement. This was in part due to its very loose structuring (leveling didn't officially happen until a few months ago...) and also in part because you truly were recognized for your experience, knowledge, and impact.
